WHAT IS THIS

tdraw.dll is an upgrade for Total Annihilation.  It patches the game to fix many bugs and add many features.
It is an integral component of the TA Community Patch, the other parts being tplayx.dll (the recorder) and server.exe (the replayer).

tdraw.dll has a long provenance dating back to the work of SY_Yeha, who introduced whiteboard markers and the TA Hook and new hotkeys to TA.
Later work by Xpoy extended hotkey support, added new shortcut commands, uni-code font support, megamap, weapon-id crack (not present in current release) and porting music patch from GOG version,
and later support was provided by Rime.

The present release includes contributions from Axle and FunkyFresh, and owes a debt to TAG_Venom for extensive testing and critical feeback, and to Gamma and Wotan for further testing and feature suggestions.

NEW FEATURES IN DETAIL:

- Start positions

  Start positions are now assigned based on battleroom teams/alliances.
  With fixed positions, host and their team are assigned the odd positions in the order that they joined the lobby.
  With random positions, host and their team are randomly assigned the even or odd positions, and they are assigned in random order.

  The Teams icons now function correctly, so they can be used to arrange teams in the battleroom if desired.
  This is optional, it is perfectly fine to arrange teams by creating alliances too.

- Autoteam

  In the battleroom, host can type "+autoteam" to have teams assigned automatically.
  These teams will then determine the start positions as described above.

  If launched from TAF, the battleroom +autoteam will assign autobalanced teams based on the player rating.
  Otherwise teams are assigned randomly.
  The +randomteam command is available to use should you prefer random teams over autobalanced teams.

  Alternatively, if host types "+autoteam" in-game, alliances are created based on actual start positions.
  
  For more than 2 teams, host can type eg "+autoteam 3" to create the desired number of teams.

- MexSnap and WreckSnap

  This patch includes ability to snap mexes and geos to the nearest metal or geo patch (MexSnap),
  and to snap reclaim commands to the nearest reclaim (WreckSnap).

  While holding down shift, press q and e alternately to switch between building mexes and reclaiming features.

  If Mex/WreckSnap is temporarily interfering with your wishes,
  you can hold down alt to override it.
  The override key can be configured in the ctrl-f2 options menu.

  The Mex/WreckSnap radii can also be configured independently via the ctrl-f2 options menu.
  Press ctrl-f2, click on the "MexSnap" or "WreckSnap" field and press a number 0 to 9.
  0 disables the Mex/WreckSnap and a larger radius results in snapping to features further away.

  Note that Mex/WreckSnap is disabled by default.
  It needs to be enabled by the mod maintainer.
  If your Mex/WreckSnap radius shows as "NA" in the ctrl-f2 menu,
  it is likely that Mex/WreckSnap hasn't been enabled by your mod maintainer.

- Move Queued Orders

  After queueing a build order or a move order,
  you can later move them around by selecting the unit
  and left mouse dragging the order to a new position.

- Construction Units Patrol Behaviour

  Patrol behaviour of contructions units is modified depending on their movement orders:

    Hold Position: your construction units will only look for reclaim
    Maneuvre/roam: your construction units will both look for reclaim and for units that need repair or assist

  Mash the 'v' key to get the desired movement order and then set a patrol route.

- Neutral unit and/or per-player additional unit spawn

  To enable this feature add a "[units]" section under the "[Schema 0]" section of your map's .ota file.  eg
  
      [Schema 0]
          {
          ....
          [units]
            {
            [unit0]
                {
                Unitname=ARMHLT;
                Ident=;
                XPos=3164;
                YPos=0;
                ZPos=2250;
                Player=11;
                HealthPercentage=100;
                }
            [unit0]
                {
                Unitname=ARMPEEP;
                Ident=;
                XPos=268;
                YPos=0;
                ZPos=384;
                Player=1;
                HealthPercentage=100;
                CreationCountdown=30;
                InitialMission=p 1750 1828;
                }
            }

  These additional units will spawn in for skirmish/multiplayer.

  The "Player" key in the .ota file refers to the map position 1..10.
  Whichever player is spawned into these positions will receive ownership of the respective units.

  You can set Player=11.  If any Player=11 units are defined, then the last player (eg the 6th in a 3v3)
  receives ownership of the Player=11 units as long as they are an AI.  He does not receive ownership of any other units.

  If a player receives any units by this mechanism, they won't receive a commander.
  If you want the player to have a commander,
  then either don't define any units for that position,
  or include a commander unit in the list of units.

  The required fields for each unit are UnitName, XPos, ZPos and Player.
  YPos and HealthPercentage are ignored.
  Optional CreationCountdown is in seconds and InitialMission works.
  Optional Ident makes it possible to refer to the unit in InitialMission of another unit.
  You'll have to look at eg totala4.hpi/maps/*.OTA for examples of InitialMission scripts to copy.

- Per-Unit Veterancy Customization

  This patch introduces new optional keys for unit definition files (units/*.fbi)
  that allow you to customize veterancy behavior for individual units.
  
  Example
  
    [UNITINFO]
    {
    UnitName=ARMMART;
    ...
    VeterancyThresholds=6 12 18 24 30; // OTA default: 5 10 15 20 25
    VeterancyAccuracyBuffRate=3; // OTA default: 12
    }
  
  New Keys
  
  - VeterancyThresholds:
    Sets the number of kills required to reach each veterancy level (VetLevel).
    Example: "6 12 18 24 30" means:
    - 6 kills for VetLevel 1
    - 12 kills for VetLevel 2
    - 18 kills for VetLevel 3
    - etc.
    OTA's default thresholds are "5 10 15 20 25".
  
  - VeterancyAccuracyBuffRate:
    Controls how quickly a unit’s weapon accuracy improves with kills, independently of veterancy levels.
    - Accuracy starts at a factor of 1 with 0 kills.
    - This factor increases by +1 every VeterancyAccuracyBuffRate kills.
    - Formula: accuracyFactor = 1 + floor(kills / VeterancyAccuracyBuffRate)
    - OTA’s default rate is 12.
    - Set to zero to disable accuracy buff altogether
  
  Veterancy Effects (Unchanged)
  
  This patch does NOT change what veterancy levels do, only how they are earned.
  For reference, each VetLevel in OTA gives:
  
  - Capture cost: +10% worker time needed to capture the unit
  - Damage taken: -4% damage received
  - Damage dealt: +6% damage dealt
  - Target tracking: improved weapon target tracking (effect uncertain)
  - Reload time: -6% weapon reload time
  - Accuracy buff: improved firing accuracy (randomness reduced by an increasing factor)
  
  Note: Reload time also appears to be affected by the unit’s health.
  
  Veterancy Limits
  
  OTA limits:
  - Capture cost: no limit
  - Damage taken: up to 5 levels
  - Damage dealt: up to 5 levels
  - Target tracking: up to 1 level
  - Reload time: up to 5 levels
  - Accuracy buff: no limit
  
  With this patch:
  - Capture cost: no limit
    Beyond the last specified threshold, kill requirements are extrapolated linearly from the last two thresholds.
  - Damage taken: up to 25 levels or the number of VeterancyThresholds, whichever is lower
  - Damage dealt: up to the number of VeterancyThresholds
  - Target tracking: up to 1 level
  - Reload time: up to 16 levels or the number of VeterancyThresholds, whichever is lower
  - Accuracy buff: no limit
