- Reduced spamminess of .voteready.
- aliased .voteready command to .ready.
- Fixed posible once in a blue moon crashes caused by sharelos code being 
  touched while the sharelos code was only partially installed.

  Before any of the injected code can be touched.

v0.99b3.503

v0.99b3.497
- ShareMapPos only generates events when the map view changes, 
  instead of spamming the connection
- Added .autopause command. Autopauses at the start of a game. 
  Stops anyone up the host from unpausing 1st(unless the host drops)
  Works even if the person unpausing doesnt have the latest version.

- Fixed some issues with the .take code
- Added warning about watchers doing a .take

- Posible fix on the multi-line bug. Not positive it breaks something or is 100% effective

v0.99b3.472
- Added .polldp command. Reports the DirectPlay Players known on each client with the same of greater version 
- Cleanup how TDPlay.GetPlayerName reads the player's name (Reverse engineering a known data structure is stupid)

  Results from TA sending a broadcast msg, and Dplay sending multipule messages to the same location.
  Even when Dplay does not report the players at the duplicate point.
